Dr. Jane Smith, a renowned neuroscientist at Stanford University, announced groundbreaking research findings on January 15, 2024. The study, funded by Acme Corp and the National Institutes of Health (NIH), was conducted across three locations: New York City, Boston, and the company's headquarters in San Francisco.

During the press conference held at the Marriott Hotel, Smith emphasized that her team of 12 researchers had worked tirelessly since March 2023. "This discovery will revolutionize how we understand memory formation," she stated. The CEO of Acme Corp, Michael Chen, praised the collaboration and announced an additional $5 million investment.

Notable attendees included Prof. Robert Williams from MIT, Dr. Sarah Johnson (who leads the NIH grant program), and representatives from WHO. The next phase of research will begin in Q2 2024 at their new facility in Cambridge, UK.
