**SKIPPED**

* I skipped ""Q2 2024"" because it is a time period rather than a specific date, and I was uncertain about whether it meets the criteria for extraction.
* I skipped ""the company's headquarters"" because it is already mentioned that the headquarters is in San Francisco, and extracting it separately might be redundant.
* I skipped ""representatives from WHO"" because while WHO is a clear entity, the text does not provide specific names or details about the representatives, making it uncertain. 
* I skipped ""$5 million"" because it is a value and not an entity that fits into the categories of people, organizations, locations, or dates.",True,,300,257,557,
