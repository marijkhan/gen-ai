**SKIPPED**

1. **Marriott Hotel**: I skipped this entity because, although it appears to be a location, I'm not 100% certain if it's a specific hotel chain or a generic term for a hotel. To ensure high precision, I err on the side of caution.
2. **The company's headquarters**: I skipped this phrase because it's ambiguous and already mentioned as being located in San Francisco, which is already extracted.

These skipped entities do not meet the high precision criteria, and I'm confident that the extracted entities are accurate.",True,,300,240,540,
