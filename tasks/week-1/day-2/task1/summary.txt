24. **Wi-Fi Technology Gap**: Identifies technology gaps between the device and access point.
25. **Wi-Fi Driver Availability Indication**: Notifies of available Wi-Fi driver updates.
26. **WLAN Service State Change Indication**: Reports changes in the WLAN service state.
27. **Wi-Fi Security Indication**: Provides Wi-Fi security-related information and risks.
28. **Wi-Fi Device Statistics**: Offers long-term device-level Wi-Fi statistics.

### **Common Fields Across All Events**

- **device_id**: Unique identifier of the device.
- **time**: Timestamp of the event in ISO 8601 format.
- **make**: Device manufacturer.
- **device_name**: Name of the device.
- **owner_id**: Identifier of the device owner.
- **event**: Detailed event information:
  - **ID**: Unique event identifier.
  - **analysisName**: Name of the event type.
  - **deviceMac**: MAC address of the device.
  - **epochTime**: Timestamp in epoch format.
  - **eventDate**: Event timestamp in ISO 8601 format.
  - **headerValue**: Event-specific details (varies by event type).
  - **severity**: Severity level of the event (e.g., "INFO").
  - **ssid**: SSID of the connected Wi-Fi network.
  - **timeStamp**: Event timestamp (duplicate of eventDate).
  - **wifiMac**: MAC address of the Wi-Fi interface.

### **Key Structure Patterns**

- **MAC Address Fields**: Many events include MAC addresses, e.g., **STA MAC Address**, **deviceMac**, **wifiMac**.
- **Wi-Fi Network Information**: SSID, BSSID, channel, and band are common in events related to Wi-Fi connections.
- **IP Information**: IP address, subnet mask, gateway, and DNS servers are included in IP-related events.
- **Timestamp and Epoch Time**: Events use both ISO 8601 and epoch time formats for timestamps.

### **Important Field Types and Values**

- **Severity Levels**: Typically "INFO", indicating informational events.
- **Network Adapter Types**: Can be "Unknown Adapter", "Ethernet", "Loopback", "Wi-Fi", "GigabitEthernet", or "Tunnel".
- **Wi-Fi Standards**: e.g., "Wi-Fi 5 (802.11ac)", "Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax)".
- **Security Protocols**: e.g., "WPA2-Personal", "WPA3-Enterprise", "Open".
