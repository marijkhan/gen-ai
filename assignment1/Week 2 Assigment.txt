Assignment 2
   Preference-Aware Travel RAG Assistant
Objective
Build a small but complete RAG system that answers travel questions (e.g., “3-day Berlin trip with cheap food and art”) using web content, preferences, and retrieval-grounded answers.
The goal is to demonstrate end-to-end RAG thinking, not to build a perfect product.
Hard Requirements
* Use Groq for all LLM calls (query understanding, judging, answer generation).

* Use one open-source embedding model (justify choice briefly).

* Use any vector DB except Chroma (FAISS / Qdrant / Weaviate / Milvus).

* Build a minimal UI (Streamlit or similar).

* System must clearly show:
query → retrieval → reasoning → answer

Core Capabilities
1. Source Ingestion
   * Start from a small fixed list of travel URLs (5–10 is enough).

   * Fetch and clean text.

   * Chunk the text using one simple strategy (paragraph or fixed size).

   * Attach minimal metadata:

      * url

      * city

      * category (food / art / sightseeing)

      * price_level (cheap / medium / expensive)

2. Preference Extraction
         * Extract preferences from the user query (budget, interests, city).

         * Use simple rules or one LLM call.

         * Output preferences as a small JSON object.

3. Retrieval + Re-ranking
            * Use semantic search via your vector DB.

            * Apply basic metadata filtering (city, category, price).

            * Add one re-ranking step (LLM judge or simple scoring).

4. Context Quality Check (Lightweight Judge)
               * Before answering, decide:

                  * context_good or context_insufficient

                     * If insufficient:

                        * either refuse,

                        * or relax filters and retry once.

5. Answer Generation
                           * Use Groq to generate the final answer using:

                              * user query

                              * retrieved chunks

                                 * Prefer grounded answers (light citations encouraged, not mandatory).

UI Requirements (Minimal)
Your UI must show:
                                    * user query input

                                    * final answer

                                    * debug panel showing:

                                       * URLs used

                                       * top retrieved chunks

                                       * extracted preferences

Deliverables (End of Day)
                                          1. Working code in a GitHub repo

                                          2. Simple architecture diagram (even a hand-drawn one is fine)

                                          3. Short README explaining:

                                             * embedding choice

                                             * vector DB choice

                                             * one failure case you observed
