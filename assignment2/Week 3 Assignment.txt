WEEK 3 Assignment
Use Case
Build an agentic content-curation system that helps a user generate high-quality LinkedIn post content on a given topic.
Example user query:
“I want to post about recent trends in GenAI agents for backend engineers.”
The system must:
* discover recent, relevant content

* synthesize it into a LinkedIn-style post

* generate a relevant image

* expose the entire flow through a planner-driven agentic system

High-Level Architecture
The system must be agent-oriented, not a simple pipeline.
Agents
   1. Planner Agent

   2. Executor Agent(s) (tools)

   3. Generator Agent

   4. Editor Agent

Tech Constraints
      * Use LangChain or LlamaIndex (developer chooses)

      * Use FastAPI for backend agent orchestration

      * Use Streamlit as UI (client only)

      * Do NOT post to LinkedIn ,final output is shown in streamlit UI

Agent Responsibilities
         1. Planner Agent (Core Brain)
Role
         * Analyze user intent

         * Decide which tools to call

         * Decide execution order:

            * parallel vs sequential

Planner must output a plan like:
{
  "steps": [
    {"step": 1, "tool": "google_search_api", "depends_on": []},
    {"step": 2, "tool": "x_search_api", "depends_on": []},
    {"step": 3, "tool": "content_generator", "depends_on": [1, 2]},
    {"step": 4, "tool": "content_editor", "depends_on": [3]},
    {"step": 5, "tool": "image_generator", "depends_on": []}
  ]
}






How does this plan execute?
               * Steps 1, 2, and 5 can run in parallel (no dependencies).

               * Step 3 waits for search results from steps 1 and 2.

               * Step 4 waits for the generated content from step 3.

               * The planner doesn’t say “parallel” or “sequential” — dependencies define execution order.




                  2. Executor Agents / Tools
The planner can invoke these tools:
                  * Search Tool

                     * Google Search API / Gemini / Perplexity (any free option)

                     * Fetch latest content on the topic

                        * Summarization Tool

                           * Condense raw articles into key points

                              * Image Generation Tool

                                 * Generate a visual matching the topic

Each tool must:
                                    * have a clear schema

                                    * return structured output

                                    * be callable independently

                                       3. Generator Agent
Role
                                       * Take aggregated content

                                       * Generate a LinkedIn-style post

                                          * concise

                                          * professional

                                          * audience-aware

Output must include:
                                             * headline

                                             * post body

                                             * hashtags

                                                4. Editor Agent
Role
                                                * Improve clarity, tone, and structure

                                                * Ensure post is suitable for LinkedIn

                                                * Finalize the content
